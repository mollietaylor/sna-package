This is a work-in-progress. Hopefully one day it will be an R package that will help take a dataset consisting of a list of individuals and their associations and transform that into a social network matrix. It will also include some extra functionality for which individuals to include, etc.

License

I'll figure out the exact license later, but it will be open source of some sort. Feel free to play with it.
